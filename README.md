# 🧾 PayrollCalculator: Java File-Based Payroll Processing Tool

A file-driven Java application that reads employee data from a source file, calculates gross pay, and outputs structured payroll information to a destination file. This project demonstrates practical Java skills including file I/O, data parsing, and exception handling in a real-world payroll scenario.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 📝 **User provides file names** for input and output during runtime.
2. 📂 **Reads from a structured employee data file**:
   - Format: `id|name|hours|payRate`
3. 🧮 **Calculates gross pay** for each employee:
   - `grossPay = hours * payRate`
4. 💾 **Writes the results** to a separate output file:
   - Output format: `id,name,grossPay`
5. ✅ **Skips header rows** and verifies valid data entries before processing.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. 🛠️ Run the program in a Java-supported IDE or terminal
2. 📤 When prompted:
   - Enter the name of the **input file** (e.g., `employees.txt`)
   - Enter the desired **output file name** (e.g., `payroll.csv`)
3. 📁 Ensure both files are located in the `resources` directory
4. 📃 The application processes employee records and generates an output file with payroll data
